How does your better heuristic improve on blocking (while maintaining
admissibility)?

My better heuristic improves on blocking drastically, especially when the moves to goal increases.
This heuristic still maintains admissibility because it gets the heuristic from blocking and adds to that
the number of cars that are blocking the cars that are blocking car0 (but not more than 1 for each blocking car).
Thus, the heuristic will always be greater than equal to blocking, but less than or equal to the actual cost
because the actual cost might involve more steps.

If you implemented the bonus heuristic, how does it improve on
Manhattan (while maintaining admissibility)?
