    \section{Inductive Proofs}

    Prove each of the following claims by induction

    \begin{claim}
      The sum of the first $n$ odd numbers is $n^2$.  That is, $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (2i-1) = n^2$
    \end{claim}

    \begin{claim}
      $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \dfrac{1}{2^i} = 1 - \dfrac{1}{2^n}$
    \end{claim}

    \section{Recursive Invariants}
    
    The function \texttt{minEven}, given below in pseudocode, takes as input an array $A$ of size $n$ of numbers.  It returns the smallest \textit{even} number in the array.  If no even numbers appear in the array, it returns positive infinity ($+\infty$).  Using induction, prove that the \texttt{minEven} function works correctly.  Clearly state your recursive invariant at the beginning of your proof.

    \begin{alltt}
Function minEven(A,n)
  If n = 0 Then
    Return +\ensuremath{\infty}
  Else
    Set best To minEven(A,n-1)
    If A[n-1] < best And A[n-1] is even Then
      Set best To A[n-1]
    EndIf
    Return best
  EndIf
EndFunction
    \end{alltt}
