"""
This is a sample python program with some things to fix in it.
Read through the file looking for the comment lines (ones that start
with a hash tag (#)), and try to do what they ask. Don't worry if you
mess up the file -- it's only for practice!
"""

# First: go to the bottom of the file with Cntl+End
# (that means hold down the Control key and then hit the End key)

print("Welcome to CS21!")

# Next: go to line 80 using Cntl+g and then entering 80 in the pop-up box


# The line below is a mess. Please delete it by moving the
# cursor to it (using the arrow keys) and using Shift+Del


# the two "print" lines below need to be indented. Move the cursor to
# the first print line and hit Cntl+l twice to select the lines (or you
# can highlight them by dragging the mouse across the two lines), then
# use Cntl+] to indent them (you can also unindent with Cntl+[, but leave
# the two print lines indented)
for num in range(10):
print(num)
print("--------------")

# Note: here's yet another way to highlight lines or text:
#        use Shift+downarrow to select from the cursor down
#        use Shift+uparrow to select from the cursor up
#        use Shift+leftarrow to select from the cursor left
#        use Shift+downarrow to select from the cursor right
# try them! and hit Esc to unselect something


# if you ever want to undo or redo an edit, use Cntl+z and Cntl+Shift+z
# try deleting this line, then undoing it



# and Cntl+s saves a file. There should currently be a blue dot at the
# top of this tab -- that means there are unsaved changes. Try Cntl+s and
# the blue dot should disappear.


# these next lines are OK, but for now, we want to comment them
# all out. Use Cntl+l to select the three lines, then Cntl+/
# print("but comment me out")
# print("for now...")
# # print("this line is OK")


# What is XXYYZZ? Change them all to Comp Sci by selecting one with
# the mouse (double click on one XXYYZZ), then type Cntl+d to select
# the others, then start typing what you want (Comp Sci). Hit Esc
# when you are done typing (and maybe save the file again with Cntl+s)
print("We love Comp Sci!")
print("We love Comp Sci!")
print("We love Comp Sci!")
print("We love Comp Sci!")



# Finally, use Cntl+s and Cntl+q to save and quit the file.
# If you are adventurous (!), after you save and quit, try
# running the file with this in the terminal: python3 atom-practice.py











# Yay! This is line 80. :)
# Go back to near the top with Cntl+g and then enter 16





















































# Super. Now go back to the top of the file using Ctrl+Home
