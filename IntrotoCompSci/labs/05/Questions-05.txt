Summary short-answer questions:

1. What does the following code print? If there is an error, explain why.

def foo(val):
    val[0] = "b"
    print(val)
    return len(val)

def main():
    temp = "lol"
    x = foo(temp)
    print(x, temp)

main()
  The following code does not print anything. Since temp is set up as a string
  and the function foo is looking for a list, it cannot replace the first letter
  of the string with "b"

2. What does the following code print? If there is an error, explain why.


def foo(val):
    val[0] = "b"
    print(val)
    return len(val)

def main():
    temp = ["l", "o", "l"]
    x = foo(temp)
    print(x, temp)

main()

  The code above prints the 3 and the list [b,o,l].
  the b replaces the first letter in temp.
3. What is the difference between a mutable and immutable datatype? Give an
example of each.
    A mutable datatype is an object you can change anywhere in the program
      ex: a list is a mutable dataype


    An immutable datatype is an object that cannot be altered after it's been
    created.
     ex: a string is an immutable datatype. if want to change the string, one of
     ways to go around the immutability would be to create a new string by
     accumulating on an empty
