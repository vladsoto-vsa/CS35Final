I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEARTS
I LOVE YOU WITH ALL OF MY HEART
I LOVE YOU!
I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT
I MADE A PIG OF MYSELF
I MADE A VOW
I MADE YOU DINNER
I MEAN IT FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART
I MIGHT NEED A LIFT TO THE AIRPORT
I MISJUDGED YOU
I MISS YOU
I MUST BE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT
I MUST BE DREAMING
I MUST HAVE OVERSLEPT
I NEVER HAVE ENOUGH TIME
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE THE DAY
I POLITELY DECLINE
I REST MY CASE
I SAW IT FIRST
I SAY WITH A HEAVY HEART
I SECOND THE MOTION
I SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING
I SLEPT LIKE A BABY
I SLEPT LIKE A ROCK
I STAND CORRECTED
I TAKE EXCEPTION TO THAT
I TAUGHT HIM EVERYTHING HE KNOWS
I THINK I'M GETTING THE HANG OF THIS
I THINK I'VE CREATED A MONSTER
I THINK SOMEONE IS FOLLOWING US
I THINK THIS HOUSE IS HAUNTED
I THINK THIS HOUSE IS HAUNTED!
I THINK WE GOT OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT
I THINK WE MAKE A GREAT TEAM
I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE
I THINK YOU'LL BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT SAY THAT
I TIP MY HAT TO YOU
I WANT IT! I NEED IT! I'VE GOT TO HAVE IT!
I WANT NO INTERRUPTIONS
I WANT THE DRUMSTICK!
I WANT TO LIVE HERE
I WAS BORN READY
I WAS MISQUOTED
I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU
I WILL BE OUT OF THE OFFICE
I WILL MAINTAIN
I WISH IT WOULD NEVER END
I WON!
I WON'T BACK DOWN
I WON'T BE CHECKING MY E-MAIL WHILE I'M AWAY
I WON'T BUDGE
I WONDER HOW MANY VACATION DAYS I HAVE
I WONDER WHY
I WOULD BE DELIGHTED
I WOULD IF I COULD BUT I CAN'T
I WOULDN'T BET MONEY ON IT
I WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING
I WOULDN'T DO THAT IF I WERE YOU
I WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED FOR THE WORLD
I WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED IT FOR THE WORLD
I WOULDN'T MISS THIS FOR THE WORLD
I WOULDN'T MISS THIS FOR THE WORLD!
I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE IN YOUR SHOES
I'D BE LOST WITHOUT IT
I'D LIKE TO BUY A VOWEL
I'D LIKE TO MAKE A TOAST
I'D LIKE TO MAKE A TOAST TO THE HAPPY COUPLE
I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST
I'D LIKE TO SEE A WINE LIST
I'D LIKE TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE
I'D LIKE TO SPIN
I'D RATHER BE FISHING
I'LL ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION
I'LL BE A MONKEY'S UNCLE
I'LL BE BACK IN A JIFFY
I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE
I'LL BE IN THE SAUNA

I'LL GET THE DOOR
I'LL HAVE IT FIXED IN A FLASH
I'LL HAVE WHAT SHE'S HAVING
I'LL LOOK INTO IT LATER
I'LL NEVER HEAR THE END OF IT
I'LL RACE YOU
I'LL RACE YOU!
I'LL START MY DIET TOMORROW
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES
I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT
