Describe the biggest challenge you faced on this lab:

The biggest challenge was just understanding recursion and how it could
apply to different string evaluations/manipulations

Consider the following program.

def sumList1(ls):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(ls)):
        total = total + ls[i]
    return total

def sumList2(ls):
    if len(ls) == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return ls[0] + sumList2(ls[1:])

def main():
    testL = [5, 2, 3]
    result1 = sumList1(testL)
    result2 = sumList2(testL)
    print("results", result1, result2)

main()


Short-answer questions:

1. In the program above there are two different solutions to summing
up a list.  Which one uses a recursive approach and which uses an
interative approach?
    sumList1 uses a iterative approach, while sumList2 uses a recursive approach.

2. In executing the call to sumList1 in the main program, what is the
maximum number of stack frames that will be on the stack?
