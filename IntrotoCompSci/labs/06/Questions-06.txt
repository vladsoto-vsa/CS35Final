The biggest challenge I face in this lab

Summary short-answer questions:

1. In this lab you implemented a blobillism library (also known as a module)
 that you then imported into both your testing program and your final program.
 Why is it useful to create a library?
 It's useful to create a library because it gives better readability and
 reusability. By reusability, I mean the function can be used for a
 wide range of purposes. 




2. In this lab you created an application with clickable buttons.
 How does the program know when a button has been pressed?

Using the getMouse method and setup rectangles or buttons on windows,
if the getMouse gives coordinates within the rectangles, the program knows
the button has been "pressed"


3. Circles are objects in the graphics library.
    If you have a circle named `c` how would you find out it's radius?
    Use c.getRadius()
