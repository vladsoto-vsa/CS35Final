Describe the biggest challenge you faced on this lab:

 The biggest challenge i faced on this lab was figuring out where to put the
 functions (like for statements) in relation to the whole program



Summary short-answer questions:

1. Again consider the following code involving a string. Does it work? Why or
   why not?

```
text = "cat"
print(text[3])
```
The range is 3 is but it starts from 0, so instead it should be print(text[2]).


2. When we use the built-in function `range(3)`, what sequence of values does
   i take on in the 'for i in range(3)' loop?

   the values i would take would be 0 to the range-1. For example, for range(3)
   it would be 0 to 2.

3. Consider the program, `tipjar.py`. What inputs can we give the program to
 quickly test whether the program is working (besides the sample output that
 we give you!)
  We can give an input of at least two customers and amount spent for each like
  $1.00. we can see it works if the total tip amount is $.20.
