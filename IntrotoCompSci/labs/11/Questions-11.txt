Describe the biggest challenge you faced on this lab:

The biggest challenge I faced in this lab was the update function. Using
if statements quite a lot made it a bit confusing



Short-answer questions:

1. For the Yard objects, which instance variable stores the "size"
   of the yard (how many items it can hold)?
   self.limit or nslots

2. For the Store objects, what method adds an item to the store,
   and what instance variable does that method change?
   addItem. It changes self.items by appending an item to the list

3. In all of our class files, what does the "self" parameter do?
    Since we are using classes that have many methods, the self
    helps us "access" the class and its methods

4. Which are better, dogs or cats?

  although I love both, dogs are more wholesome
