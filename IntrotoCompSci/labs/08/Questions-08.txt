-----------------------------------
- Search worksheet practice
-----------------------------------

Below are questions which are similar to what you might be asked on a
quiz.

Assume we are running searches that return the index of the word if it is in
the list, and return -1 if the word is not in the list.  We are given the
following list:

lst = ["bear", "bird", "bug", "cat", "cow", "dog", "fish, "lion"]

1. How many steps does it take to search for the value "cow" in the list using
linear search?
  7


2. How many steps does it take to search for the value "cow" in the list using
binary search?
3


3. Make a table to show the values for low, high, and mid for each comparison
step in searching for the animal "bear" in the list using binary search. What
is returned at the end of this algorithm?

-------------------------------------
 iteration | low | mid | high
-------------------------------------
              0      3     7
              0      1      2
              0      0      1

4. Make a table to show the values for low, high, and mid for each comparison
step in searching for the animal "elephant" in the list using binary search.
What is returned at the end of this algorithm?

-------------------------------------
 iteration | low | mid | high
-------------------------------------
              0     3     7
              4     5      7
              6     6      7
              6     6     6

            not in list
