Describe the biggest challenge you faced on this lab:

The biggest challenge I face in this lab was trying to figure out what approach
to take. I know there are multiple approaches to these kinds of problems/

Summary short-answer questions:

1. Will 5+"hello" work in python? Why or why not?
   What about 5*"hello"?

   5+"hello" will not work in python because 5 is a integer and "hello" is a string
   5*"hello" works by repeating "hello" five times.
   
2. The built-in input() function returns whatever the user inputs as
   what data type: integer, float, or string?

   The input() function returns values as strings, unless float or integer are put before it.

3. In the runner.py program, when you type in 137.9, how do you
   know the answers your program displays are correct?

   They are correct because I used a calculator and mental math to calculate the time.
