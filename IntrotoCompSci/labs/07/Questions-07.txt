Describe the biggest challenge you faced on this lab:

The biggest challenge had to be the fact that we moved online. Apart from that,
it had to be getting to display the changing cards.


Summary short-answer questions:

1. Briefly describe the steps in your algorithm to get from the user
which card to flip, and how your program avoids crashing when the user enters
something invalid.

The program first displays the cards and intro and asks which two cards they
want to match. My program then avoids crashing when the user enters something invalid by evaluating
whether or not the user's input is a number between 0 and 9. If it's not,
it will print "Select a card 0-9" until the user chooses a valid number.

If it's valid, then it verifies if the two inputs are the same or if
they've been entered before. If this is the case, then they go again. If not,
those values are taken to index into the "hidden list" and "number list" to
swap strings in the lists. 

2. Briefly describe one benefit of doing the design *first*.

Since programs like these require a lot of functions, it can be quite daunting
when you're not sure what each one should do. By doing the design first,
it gave me an idea of how I wanted to approach my program and how each
function would depend on another.
